## Purpose / Focus

 Ecopet is a veterinary website developed as part of an academic project for the Software Construction course at Polit√©cnico Colombiano Jaime Isaza Cadavid University. This project aims to provide a digital platform for managing veterinary services, improving the experience for both pet owners and veterinary staff.

The website offers an intuitive interface for booking appointments, accessing essential pet care services, and managing information related to pet health. It brings together modern web technologies like Angular for frontend development and Node.js, Express, and Sequelize for backend functionality.

Key Features:

Easy-to-use service booking system.
Mobile-responsive design to ensure accessibility across devices.
Secure and efficient backend for managing data.
This project reflects the knowledge gained during the course and demonstrates the practical application of software development principles in the context of veterinary care. Contributions and feedback are encouraged to further enhance the platform.

### Database Creation

First connect with postgres user or another user with superuser privileges, then in Login/Group roles, create new Login/Group

![Create User](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037567655424569344/1226744128545624094/image.png?ex=6625e180&is=66136c80&hm=e749501908eb2d94d4422fa7ec301c1c89549eabb8fc56a3f93419f3fcefc7b9&)

the user name is "CRMWU", in Definition put the password "1234" and configure the privileges.git

![Admin User](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037567655424569344/1227017339954921513/image.png?ex=6626dff2&is=66146af2&hm=4fd72eb7ccb04d363fcde06d8d161b3f66b30ab0603f5df309228b86ebef7d8c&)

![user Privileges](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037567655424569344/1227017408871665775/image.png?ex=6626e003&is=66146b03&hm=624d3a076844e8a94aba883fc4bab986fc9793917e794fcf3f8e78904d7ae11d&)

once the user has been created, proceed to register a new server wiht the name "ECOPET_DB"

![new server](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037567655424569344/1226745562208927794/image.png?ex=6625e2d5&is=66136dd5&hm=bda080d1a89b9713752b625a52e21cd284075252b7c82d7080686457395ffaa1&)

![Register - Server](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037567655424569344/1227018162654941225/image.png?ex=6626e0b6&is=66146bb6&hm=6fe9c09f642e3186f7e40682e0a53111ea1002aa11807f05fc4aa369f6bc6196&)

In connection configure the hostname, in unsername place the user previously created and the password

![connection](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037567655424569344/1227018216065466521/image.png?ex=6626e0c3&is=66146bc3&hm=efbe0c4445aadc2dd030dbca2368862476a444c10e81cd53bf2c7c7badfa15a2&)

Finally, proceed to create a new database with the name "ECOPET_DB" in the newly created server instance

![create DB](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037567655424569344/1226747124151226428/image.png?ex=6625e44a&is=66136f4a&hm=a073ca712996d440a775d3dc2738f51b441568b388687f92abf741fe407744b4&)

![create DB CRMWU_DB](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1037567655424569344/1227018940404863026/image.png?ex=6626e170&is=66146c70&hm=cd7fce12c181e293c15f5bf322b8c6f25f6ff00806d8ef36bd9231295e3a985d&)

### Sequelize synchronization

As the project is running in a local environment, it is required to manually synchronize the data used in the system, such as users, categories, products, etc.
This action only needs to be performed once!

1. First, in a terminal, located in the project's main folder, execute `npm install` to install all dependencies.

2. Located in the project's main folder, execute `npm run sync` to synchronize all models in the database and insert all used data

---

### Start Project

if you have already performed the previous steps, you can initialize the project by running `npm run dev `on the backend terminal and in the frontend terminal `ng serve ` located in the project's main folder. then you can view the project with any browser by visiting
http://localhost:4200/

# Construction details
The system follows a three-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database).

- Frontend: A web application that directly interacts with users (veterinary, admimn, owners).
- Backend: A REST API that processes requests and manages business logic.
- Database: A relational database to store information about veterinary, admimn, owners.

## Technologies Used
Frontend
- **Framework**: Angular  

Backend
- **Language**: Node.js with Express

Database
- **Relational database**: PostgreSQL

# Resources used

- **Icons**: We used [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com/) for all the icons across the application. Boxicons is an easy-to-use, open-source library of icons perfect for modern web apps.

- **Backend**: The server is built with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/), providing a robust REST API.

- **Database**: We used [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) as our relational database. You can download and install it from the following links:
  - [PostgreSQL Download](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
  - [PostgreSQL Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
  
- **Framework for Building Web Apps**: The project also includes [Angular](https://angular.io/) for building dynamic web applications. You can install Angular by following these links:
  - [Angular CLI Installation Guide](https://angular.io/cli)
  - [Angular Documentation](https://angular.io/docs)
